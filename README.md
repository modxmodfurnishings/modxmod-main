# MODxMOD Main Project

## Rationale

Furniture and devices should adapt to people, not the other way around.
MODxMOD strives to create an open system (the System) of integration between
hardware-to-hardware components, as well as hardware-to-software and
software-to-software components.  As an organization, we will provide these
components and devices, but the open source nature of this project allows
anyone to build upon and adapt the technology to their personal needs.

## System Parts

MODxMOD's System describes several pieces:

- Naming and templates for parts
- Naming and templates interfaces
- Naming and workflows for interactions
- Templates for various solutions

## Designs that change

Designs in this repository are subject to change, especially those in the
Labs folder.
